# Get Help with a Project
Do you have a project that we can work on with you?

At SWB we are always looking to expand our list of collaborators and projects. If you are working in absolutely any field of international health and would benefit from working with an expert group of statisticians then we would love to hear from you.  Some examples of projects that we have worked on previously can be found here Past Projects  These projects include the design and analysis of epidemiological studies, the review of grant proposals for funding agencies in international health (health considered very broadly), and on-site training for current health projects or for the development of local staff. If you have any ideas for projects that fall within the general scope of statistics and international health we would love to talk further with you.  
  
## How to suggest a new project
To initiate a new project, please email the organizers of Statistics Without Borders at fisherjs@gmail.com with a brief outline describing who you are and the project that you would like help with. If you would like to talk to us more generally about ways we could help your organization, that is also fine. We will then assign a team of Statistics Without Borders volunteers to work on your project under an SWB project leader, and work with you to bring the project to fruition. If you have any questions about this process or with any rough ideas for a project, please email us at fisherjs@gmail.com and weâ€™d love to talk to you.
